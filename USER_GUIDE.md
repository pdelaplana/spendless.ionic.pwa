# Spendless User Guide & FAQ


## Getting Started

### What is Spendless?

Spendless is a mindful spending tracker that helps you become more aware of your financial habits. Unlike traditional budgeting apps, we focus on emotional awareness and understanding *why* you spend, not just what you spend on.

### How do I create my first wallet?

1. After signing in, tap the "+" button on the main spending page
2. Choose "New Wallet"
3. Give your wallet a name (e.g., "Personal", "Household", "Entertainment")
4. Set your spending limit for the current period
5. Start tracking your spending!

### What are spending periods?

Spending periods help you track your spending in manageable time frames. You can choose to set it up as:
- **Weekly**: Monday to Sunday
- **Bi-weekly**: Every two weeks
- **Monthly**: Based on calendar month or custom start date

**Automation**: When you create a new period, Spendless automatically generates any active **Recurring Spends** that fall within those dates, so you don't have to enter them manually mỗi time.

### How do I set my preferred currency?

Go to Settings → Regional Settings → Preferred Currency and select from our list of supported currencies.

## Core Features

### Wallets

Wallets are spending categories that help you organize your money. Think of them as virtual envelopes:
- Create separate wallets for different purposes (groceries, entertainment, bills)
- Set spending limits for each wallet
- Track how much you have left in real-time
- View wallet history and patterns

### Adding Spending

1. Tap the "+" button
2. Select the wallet
3. Enter the amount
4. Choose a mindful category
5. Select an emoji to describe your mood
6. Tap "Save"

### Emotional Awareness

Spendless helps you understand the "why" behind your spending by tracking your emotional state:

1.  **Select your Mood**: When adding a spend, select the emoji that best describes how you feel (Happy, Stressed, Tired, etc.).
2.  **1-Tap Context**: Use the "Context Chips" below the mood selection to quickly add reasons for your feeling (e.g., "Celebrating a win", "Rough day at work").
3.  **Custom Contexts**: Tap the "+" chip to add your own personal phrases. Spendless will remember these for next time!
4.  **Notes Sync**: Tapping a context chip automatically adds it to your notes field. You can still type custom notes alongside them.

### Mindful Categories

We use 6 mindful categories to help you understand your spending patterns:

#### 🛡️ Essentials - "Keeps my life running smoothly"

Essential purchases you need for daily life (groceries, rent, utilities, medications)

#### ☕ Rituals - "Daily habits that sustain me"

Regular habits that bring structure and comfort to your routine (morning coffee, gym membership, commute)

#### ✨ Rewards - "Brings ME joy and pleasure"

Purchases purely for your enjoyment and happiness (nice dinner, new book, concert tickets)

#### 📈 Growth - "Invests in my future self"

Spending that develops your skills, health, or future (courses, coaching, quality tools, health checkups)

#### 💝 Connection - "Nurtures my relationships"

Spending that strengthens bonds with others (gifts, date nights, group activities, family events)

#### ⚡ Unexpected - "Life's surprises"

Unplanned expenses and emergencies (car repairs, medical emergencies, replacing broken items)

### Recurring Spending

Set up your regular bills, subscriptions, and habits once, and Spendless will manage them for you.

#### Managing Recurring Spends
1. Open the main menu (☰) and select **Recurring Spending**
2. Tap the "+" button to add a new recurring expense
3. Define the **Schedule**:
   - **Weekly**: Choose the day of the week
   - **Fortnightly**: Choose the day of the week and start date
   - **Monthly**: Choose the day of the month
4. Select the **Wallet**, **Category**, and **Amount**
5. Save to activate the automation

#### How Auto-Generation Works
When you create a new **Accounting Period**, Spendless scans your active recurring spends and:
- Calculates all occurrences that fall within the new period's start and end dates.
- Maps them to the correct wallets (falling back to your default wallet if names have changed).
- Provides a **Preview Step** where you can see exactly what will be created before you confirm.
- Instantly creates individual spend records in the new period.

This ensures your fixed costs are always accounted for at the start of every period, giving you a crystal clear view of your remaining "fun money."

### Mood Analysis & Insights

Gain deeper understanding of your habits by visiting the Mood Analysis dashboard:

1.  Open the main menu (☰) and select **Insights**.

    -   **Drill-down**: Tap any mood segment (like "Stressed") to see the specific contextual phrases driving that spending.
    -   **Back Navigation**: Use the back arrow next to the title to return to the high-level mood overview.
4.  **Data-Driven Insights**: Scroll down to see automated highlights:
    -   **Highest Spending Mood**: Identifying which emotion leads to your biggest expenses.

- **Celebrate Positive Patterns**: Notice which purchases made while feeling "Happy" or "Grateful" brought the most lasting value.
- **Review Regularly**: Use the Mood Insights card at the end of each period to set intentions for the next one.
