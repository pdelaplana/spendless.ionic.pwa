# Spendless User Guide & FAQ


## Getting Started

### What is Spendless?

Spendless is a mindful spending tracker that helps you become more aware of your financial habits. Unlike traditional budgeting apps, we focus on emotional awareness and understanding *why* you spend, not just what you spend on.

### How do I create my first wallet?

1. After signing in, tap the "+" button on the main spending page
2. Choose "New Wallet"
3. Give your wallet a name (e.g., "Personal", "Household", "Entertainment")
4. Set your spending limit for the current period
5. Start tracking your spending!

### What are spending periods?

Spending periods help you track your spending in manageable time frames. You can choose to set it up as:
- **Weekly**: Monday to Sunday
- **Bi-weekly**: Every two weeks
- **Monthly**: Based on calendar month or custom start date

Your wallets reset at the start of each period, giving you a fresh start.
